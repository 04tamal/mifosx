Lost permissions again... restore fixed it up... must be some prob with permissions/roles maintenance
also, maybe I should be using a user that has everything but role admin.
recreate() problem ME DO

list clients notes - noteType needs a 'text' DOING
	createdOn & updatedOn values... do they need reformatting? DOING

updating client note - ignores clientId anyhow! so is it really a notes resource? DOING

Formatted field still there DOING

loan retrieve DOING
break up data into categories.. e.g. 
Basic - lifeCycleStatusText thru
Convenience - open thru waitingForDisbursal then maxSubmittedOnOffsetFromToday, maxApprovedOnOffsetFromToday , maxDisbursedOnOffsetFromToday, actualLoanTermInDays, actualLoanTermInMonths,  loanTermInDays, loanTermInMonths
Permission - undoDisbursalAllowed, waiveAllowed, makeRepaymentAllowed, rejectAllowed, withdrawnByApplicantAllowed, undoApprovalAllowed, disbursalAllowed, anyActionOnLoanAllowed
