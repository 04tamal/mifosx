POSSIBLE CHANGES TO APP OR DOCUMENTATION


list clients notes - noteType needs a 'text' DOING
	createdOn & updatedOn values... do they need reformatting? DOING


updating client note - produces valid json message although if the clientId is wrong the msg is "Note with identifier 25 does not exist" rather than something like "Note with client identifier 25 does not exist"


loan template - repaymentSchedule is null - I can't see it set in the app


loan retrieve DOING
   break up data into categories.. e.g. 
   Basic - lifeCycleStatusText thru
   Convenience - open thru waitingForDisbursal then maxSubmittedOnOffsetFromToday, maxApprovedOnOffsetFromToday , maxDisbursedOnOffsetFromToday, actualLoanTermInDays,    actualLoanTermInMonths,  loanTermInDays, loanTermInMonths
   Permission - undoDisbursalAllowed, waiveAllowed, makeRepaymentAllowed, rejectAllowed, withdrawnByApplicantAllowed, undoApprovalAllowed, disbursalAllowed, anyActionOnLoanAllowed
   flatten loadData
       repaymentSchedule
       summary
       loanRepayments


Loan Transitions ... approve etc
    if  "eventLocalDate" parameter added with string date then instead of parameter not support msg do get jackson conversion exception.
    approve loan (already closed) with approval date before submitted date
    The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>org.mifosng.platform.loan.domain.InvalidLoanTimelineDate: The     date    of when loan is approved cannot be before its submittal date.

   approve loan (already closed) with approval date after submitted date
    Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null

   if I do an approve when already approved also get
   Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null

   sometimes clientId returned... always loanId OK?


Loan Transactions (repay and waive - and maybe reversal - but not disbursement) general talk needed as retrieve could work for any txn?
    transaction type... UNKNOWN(0), DISBURSEMENT(1), REPAYMENT(2), REVERSAL(3), WAIVED(4);
    Create - (command has string and proper value fields... so assume its like eventDate above)
    If you undo disbursal does it undo the loantransaction? - didnt test
    Template - does waiver amount default to 'rest of loan' cos it looked like it missed out on other waivers. didn't test
	repayment amount matches current installment outstanding amount w/o taking waivers into account.
    check descriptions - couldn't test because of invalid locale
    retrieve: display transaction type value?
    "principal" : null,   "interest" : null, total, "totalWaived" : null,   "overpaid" : null, and the offset - are nulls ever put in?
    adjust:
    when adjusting a disbursal - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:         Only repayment and waiver transactions can be adjusted.
    on create and adjust, app returns clientId can it be transaction id or loanId?



BUT NOT FOR NOWS
should be able to get clients by branch as well
also get loans of different status's by branch etc
list of loan transactions not available (except in summary - presume repayments section has repayments and waivers and adjusts)




DOCUMENTATION REMAINING
