Lost permissions again... restore fixed it up... must be some prob with permissions/roles maintenance
also, maybe I should be using a user that has everything but role admin.
recreate() problem ME DO - couldn't recreate by update user roles... maybe was to do with office 1 have a parentId?



list clients notes - noteType needs a 'text' DOING
	createdOn & updatedOn values... do they need reformatting? DOING

updating client note - ignores clientId anyhow! so is it really a notes resource? DOING

loan template
Formatted field still there DOING

loan retrieve DOING
break up data into categories.. e.g. 
Basic - lifeCycleStatusText thru
Convenience - open thru waitingForDisbursal then maxSubmittedOnOffsetFromToday, maxApprovedOnOffsetFromToday , maxDisbursedOnOffsetFromToday, actualLoanTermInDays, actualLoanTermInMonths,  loanTermInDays, loanTermInMonths
Permission - undoDisbursalAllowed, waiveAllowed, makeRepaymentAllowed, rejectAllowed, withdrawnByApplicantAllowed, undoApprovalAllowed, disbursalAllowed, anyActionOnLoanAllowed

flatten loadData
repaymentSchedule
summary
loanRepayments

---------------------------------------------
LOAN TRANSITIONS approve etc.
if  "eventLocalDate" parameter added with string date then instead of parameter not support msg do get jackson conversion exception.

approve loan (already closed) with approval date before submitted date
The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>org.mifosng.platform.loan.domain.InvalidLoanTimelineDate: The date of when loan is approved cannot be before its submittal date.

approve loan (already closed) with approval date after submitted date
Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null

if I do an approve when already approved also get
Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null




sometimes clientId returned... always loanId OK?

LOAN TRANSACTIONS (repay and waive - and maybe reversal - but not disbursement) general talk needed as retrieve could work for any txn?
transaction type... UNKNOWN(0), DISBURSEMENT(1), REPAYMENT(2), REVERSAL(3), WAIVED(4);
Create - (command has string and proper value fields... so assume its like eventDate above)
If you undo disbursal does it undo the loantransaction? - didnt test
Template - does waiver amount default to 'rest of loan' cos it looked like it missed out on other waivers. didn't test
	repayment amount matches current installment outstanding amount w/o taking waivers into account.
check descriptions - couldn't test because of invalid locale

retrieve: display transaction type value?

"principal" : null,   "interest" : null, total, "totalWaived" : null,   "overpaid" : null, and the offset - are nulls ever put in?

adjust:
when adjusting a disbursal - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Only repayment and waiver transactions can be adjusted.

 on create and adjust returns clientId can it be transaction id or loanId?
list of loan transactions not available (except in summary presume repayments has repayments and waivers and adjusts)

---------------------------------------------------------
should be able to get clients by branch as well (but not for now)
also get loans of different status's by branch etc (but not for now)

Loans - what does Keith think about a description

Identify Fields that need explaining
