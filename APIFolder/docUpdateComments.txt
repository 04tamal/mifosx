\loan\?\transactions\id get exception if loan doesn't match id.... should loan be taken out here?
template for waiver/repayment... is it same for both? no type needed? (might have got this wrong)

new loan template ... is it 2 templates... one to pick product... and 2nd to return default properties in selected product or is it meant that if only one product then use that. 

Configuration
If you put a new currency config in and it deletes a currently in using { "selectedItems": ["USD", "GBP","XOF","ETB"] } then an exception report is returned
Works fine using currencies (updated docs)....
and should it return just an ok and empty set rather than empty notSelectedCurrencies and currencies
should update only select currencies and not allow notSelectedCurrencies?


Offices
When creating new offices.. do i have to supply  "dateFormat": & "openingDateFormatted" for openingDate?  What is list of dateFormats?
openingDate seems mandatory... but when the 'pair' not supplied I get NullPointerException
could just openingDate be used?
Note that openingData is passed as openingDateFormatted and a dateFormat is provided to convert the date from the way your UI records it to a common format.
