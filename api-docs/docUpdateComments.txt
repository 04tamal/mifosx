POSSIBLE CHANGES TO APP OR DOCUMENTATION


list clients notes and a note - createdOn & updatedOn values... still need reformatting? DOING

permissions? or what can happen?
-------------------------------------------


Loan Transitions ... approve etc - possible done CHECK AFTER
    if  "eventLocalDate" parameter added with string date then instead of parameter not support msg do get jackson conversion exception. - KW might to jackson conversion exception to json.
    approve loan (already closed) with approval date before submitted date
    The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>org.mifosng.platform.loan.domain.InvalidLoanTimelineDate: The     date    of when loan is approved cannot be before its submittal date.

   approve loan (already closed) with approval date after submitted date
    Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null

   if I do an approve when already approved also get
   Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null; SQL [n/a]; constraint [null]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null


   sometimes clientId returned... always loanId OK? DOING


Loan Transactions (repay and waive - and maybe reversal - but not disbursement) general talk needed as retrieve could work for any txn?
    transaction type... UNKNOWN(0), DISBURSEMENT(1), REPAYMENT(2), REVERSAL(3), WAIVED(4);
    Create - (command has string and proper value fields... so assume its like eventDate above)

    retrieve: display transaction type value?  DOING
    "principal" : null,   "interest" : null, total, "totalWaived" : null,   "overpaid" : null, and the offset - are nulls ever put in? DOING
    adjust:

    when adjusting a disbursal - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request.</u></p><p><b>exception</b> <pre>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:         Only repayment and waiver transactions can be adjusted. DOING
    on create and adjust, app returns clientId can it be transaction id or loanId?



BUT NOT FOR NOWS
should be able to get clients by branch as well
also get loans of different status's by branch etc
list of loan transactions not available (except in summary - presume repayments section has repayments and waivers and adjusts)




DOCUMENTATION REMAINING

describe waiver CHECK RULES AFTER
why fields "totalWaived", "overpaid" - KW DOING - CHECK AFTER
maxJoinedOnOffsetFromToday - KW DOING - CHECK AFTER

    - create a client example could show second example with the
field clientOrBusinessName being used instead of firstname, lastname,
no mention of it - done BUT NOTE displayName starts with space!

 - Loans
     - digitsAfterDecimal and currencyCode should NOT be sent during
creation - they should be inherited from the product. Likewise for
update. KW DOING - CHECK AFTER

     - Would be better if it was possible to not pass any of these
details if defaults from loan product are acceptable, they can be
inherited from loan product. KW DOING - CHECK AFTER
